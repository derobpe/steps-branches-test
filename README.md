# steps-branches-test
For future tutorials, I am going to be separating each step in a new branch, making it easy to follow.

The appearance of the readme would be something similar to the following:

## steps
Each step is a branch. Check out to the step you want to test.

```bash
$ git checkout <step-number>    # eg: git checkout step-1
```
* [step-0](https://github.com/derobpe/steps-branches-test/commits/step-0) - Adding a first branch `step-0`.
* [step-1](https://github.com/derobpe/steps-branches-test/commits/step-1) - Adding a new branch `step-1`, from scratch.

Everytime I can pull each branch to merge it with the `main` branch
* [step-2](https://github.com/derobpe/steps-branches-test/commits/step-2) - Adding a new branch `step-2`, from the old `step-1` branch.
* and so on..
